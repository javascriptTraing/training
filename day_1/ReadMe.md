Javascript (JS) is an object oriented programing language.
Javascript can be used on client side as well as server side.
Javascript is losely typed programing language. We don't need to specify the type of varible
JS works on browser as well as without brower.
If without browser we need NodeJs.
NodeJs is a framework needed to run the JS code.
for loop has 3 parts, 1, initialization 2, condition 3, increament or decrement
If you want to check if the given varible is an array or not can use Array.isArray()
Many third party library can be easily used with nodeJs projects, these third party librarys can be installed on our system
steps:
1. create a folder
2. open that folder in a terminal
3. fire [npm init -y]
when you run the above commands a package.json file will be created
4. we have to search in npm repositrary what third party library we required
5. we can install that third party library by using [npm install] command
We can run [npm install --save-dev jest] so jest will not be part of the final bundle module used for deployment
